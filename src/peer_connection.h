RTCPeerConnection

computer and a remote peer. It provides methods to connect to a remote peer, 
maintain and monitor the connection, and close the connection once it's no 
longer needed.

The RTCPeerConnection.close() method closes the current peer connection.

Calling this method terminates the RTCPeerConnection's ICE agent, ending any
ongoing ICE processing and any active streams. This also releases any resources
in use by the ICE agent, including TURN permissions. All RTCRtpSender objects
are considered to be stopped once this returns (they may still be in the process

/*
When a web site or app using RTCPeerConnection receives a new ICE candidate from 
the remote peer over its signaling channel, it delivers the newly-received 
candidate to the browser's ICE agent by calling RTCPeerConnection.addIceCandidate(). 
This adds this new remote candidate to the RTCPeerConnection's remote 
description, which describes the state of the remote end of the connection.

If the candidate parameter is missing or a value of null is given when calling 
addIceCandidate(), the added ICE candidate is an "end-of-candidates" indicator. 
The same is the case if the value of the specified object's candidate is either 
missing or an empty string (""), it signals that all remote candidates have been 
delivered.

The end-of-candidates notification is transmitted to the remote peer using a 
candidate with an a-line value of end-of-candidates.

During negotiation, your app will likely receive many candidates which you'll 
deliver to the ICE agent in this way, allowing it to build up a list of 
potential connection methods. This is covered in more detail in the articles 
WebRTC connectivity and Signaling and video calling.

not immediately take effect. Instead, the current connection configuration 
remains in place until negotiation is complete. Only then does the agreed-upon
